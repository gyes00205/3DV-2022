# 3DV-2022
###### tags: `3DV-2022`

## Introduction
1. Follow and complete several tutorials provided on [PyTorch3D Â· A library for deep learning with 3D data](https://pytorch3d.org/tutorials/) , in which they include **"Fit mesh"**, **"Render texture meshes"**, **"Render color pointclouds"**, **"Fit a mesh via rendering"**, **"Fit a volume via raymarching"**, and **"Fit a simple Neural Radiance Field via raymarching"**.
2. Based on the source code [nctu-eva-lab/3DV-2022: 3DV-2022 (github.com)](https://github.com/nctu-eva-lab/3DV-2022) provided by our TA, in which itself is already runnable and able to produce some basic results, you should try to extend the code to make the single-view 3D reconstruction model more powerful (e.g. using a better designed decoder, tuning the hyperparameters, etc) to get better results.  Moreover, as the current version is for pointcloud and voxelgrid 3D representations, you are highly encouraged to extend the code (or even build one from scratch on you own) to tackle the meshes representation (in which this will become a bonus for you to win more credits for the final score of this course). 
## Assignment: single-view 3D reconstruction
We can see the single-view 3D reconstruction implementation in [assignment](https://github.com/gyes00205/3DV-2022/tree/main/assignment) folder.
## Tutorial
We can see the tutorial implementation in tutorial 1-6 folder.
